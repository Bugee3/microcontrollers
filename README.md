Project Overview

This repository is a collection of my work related to the STM32 Nucleo F401RE development board. My goal is to develop various embedded systems applications, including GPIO control, USART communication, and more. I will also be experimenting with the CubeMX configuration tool and integrating hardware components like LEDs, buttons, and external peripherals.
